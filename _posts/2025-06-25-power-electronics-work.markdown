# Building A Boost Converter 

This project involved the design, simulation, and experimental validation of a boost converterâ€”a DC-DC power converter that steps up voltage for applications such as power supplies and renewable energy systems. The converter was analyzed in both continuous and discontinuous conduction modes using analytical equations, MATLAB Simulink models, and hardware measurements. Simulated and measured results showed strong agreement with theoretical predictions, particularly for inductor current and efficiency. A feedback control loop was implemented using an Arduino programmed through Simulink to regulate output voltage during transient conditions. The study highlights key trade-offs in converter design, including the effects of inductor resistance, control gain, and core saturation on voltage stability and performance.
